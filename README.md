Extras for Eclipse is a collection of small extensions for the Eclipse IDE that include a launch dialog, a JUnit status bar, a launch configuration housekeeper, and little helpers to accomplish recurring tasks with keyboard shortcuts.

## Installation

Extras for Eclipse is available from the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/extras-eclipse). Just drag the icon to your running Eclipse workspace:

In the Eclipse main menu, click _Help > Install New Softwareâ€¦_, then enter the URL above and select _Extras for the Eclipse IDE_. Expand the item to select only certain features for installation.

All features can be installed separately. Please note that a JRE 8 or later and Eclipse Luna (4.4) or later are required to run this software.

The software is released continuously, and the sources listed above always contain the latest stable release. See the [news page](https://rherrmann.github.io/eclipse-extras/news) for a summary of the most recent changes.


## Requirements

**Important:** If you don't run Eclipse with Java 1.8, the update process may appear to succeed, but Extras for Eclipse will simply not show in the target installation.
